# dissimilarity
analysis of the impact of dissimilarity in recommendation through rating-based metrics


This branch is very similar to branch test1, in this work all the candidates proposed in "metriche.pdf" have been considered and a multiplicative scheme has been proposed:
Pearson/Candidate.

Files have been created for each candidate:
- user_user_candidata.csv
- top50neighbor_candidata.csv
- prediction_candidata.csv

The file that contains the word prediction is the one that contains the top10 recommendations for each user.

Later on, prediction files were also created in the format user,item,rating and as separator ="\t", but the content remained, of course, unchanged.
