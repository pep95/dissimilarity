analysis of the impact of dissimilarity in recommendation through rating-based metrics


In this work a study is made of the importance and impact of dissimilarity combined with similarity in recommendation systems. In detail, rating-based similarity metrics (Pearson and Adjusted Cosine Similarity) are modified by introducing asymmetric similarity and dissimilarity. Subsequently, the recommendations are tested using these new coefficients, and how these derived parameters can give more importance to the recommendations.
